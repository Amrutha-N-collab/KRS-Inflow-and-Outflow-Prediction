 To Predict inflow and outflow at the KSR reservoir.

 By evaluating the models based on metrics such as AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R², you highlight their effectiveness in handling different datasets. 


• Inflow Prediction: The Random Forest model performed the best with an AUC of 0.94, 
indicating high classification accuracy. Gradient Boosting followed closely with an 
AUC of 0.92, showcasing its ability to handle complex, nonlinear data relationships 
effectively. However, SVR had a significantly lower AUC of 0.73, indicating it was less 
capable of accurately predicting inflow. 


• Outflow Prediction: For outflow, Gradient Boosting achieved the highest AUC at 0.84, 
suggesting it handled the outflow dataset well. SVR performed decently, achieving an 
AUC of 0.81. However, Random Forest lagged behind, with an AUC of 0.77, indicating 
it was less effective for outflow predictions compared to inflow.
