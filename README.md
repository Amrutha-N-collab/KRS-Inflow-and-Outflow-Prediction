# KRS-Inflow-and-Outflow-Prediction
 Reservoir Inflow and Outflow Prediction for KSR Reservoir 
Given historical data on reservoir water levels, seasonal variations, and weather patterns, the task 
is to build predictive models that can accurately estimate the future inflow and outflow of the KSR 
(Krishna Raja Sagara) reservoir. The goal is to utilize the available data to develop reliable models 
that predict inflow and outflow patterns, which are essential for effective reservoir management, 
flood prevention, and water allocation. 

To make this prediction, we have employed the power of machine learning models. These include 
Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest (RF), 
which help us capture the complexities of reservoir dynamics. To enhance accessibility, we have 
integrated the Streamlit library to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. This allows users 
to visualize reservoir data and explore inflow and outflow predictions, making the tool more 
approachable for both technical and non-technical users. 

 
The objective is to create a robust framework for forecasting water inflow and outflow based on 
historical trends and influencing factors such as seasonal changes, day-of-the-week patterns, and 
meteorological conditions. This will assist water resource managers, policymakers, and decision
makers in optimizing reservoir operations and ensuring efficient water distribution. 
 
Key Challenges: 
➢ Feature Selection: Identifying the key factors that significantly impact reservoir inflow and 
outflow (e.g., storage levels, rainfall, seasonal trends). 
➢ Model Selection: Choosing the most suitable machine learning algorithms to accurately 
predict inflow and outflow rates. 
➢ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset to ensure 
consistency and accuracy in model training.
